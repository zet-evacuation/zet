/**
 * The basic framework class for algorithms. It allows to define input and
 * output of an algorithm by using generics and provides the framework to run
 * an algorithm in its own thread by implementing <code>Runnable</code>.
 * Furthermore, it keeps track of the current state of the algorithm and
 * provides an generic exception handling that can be extended by overwriting
 * <code>handleException</code>. It also keeps track of the algorithms runtime
 * and offers simple logging features that should be preferred to System.out
 * logging. Finally it offers the possibility to dispatch information about the
 * algorithm's state and progress to listeners, that can register and unregister
 * themselves for the algorithms events.
