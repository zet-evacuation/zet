 * A class that represents an implicitly given sequence of doubles, that is 
 * uniformly distributed between a start and an end value, with a specified step 
 * in between two doubles. Notice that the step does not need to be an double
 * - the returned doubles are rounded values of an internal floating point 
 * number. The two boundary values are always part of the returned sequence, 
 * even when starting from the first value with the specified step would 
 * normally not stop at the end value. If start and end value are the same, the 
 * sequence contains just this one double.
