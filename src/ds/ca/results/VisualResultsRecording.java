/**
 * This class serves as a container for visualization results of a simulation
 * with a cellular automaton. We store an initial configuration of the 
 * automaton together with actions which reflect changes on the configuration.
 * By executing the actions in the same order as they were recorded, one can 
 * "replay" the simulation without re-computation of the cellular automaton.
 *  
 * This class also provides the methods for replaying the recorded actions
 * in the correct order. To do so, we provide a "current time step" in the
 * recording. You can move this time step forward and backwards in the
 * recording to see the actions at different points in time. The time step
 * is initialized with <code>-1</code>, yet the recording starts at time 
 * <code>0</code>! This enables you to iterate through all time steps by 
 * repeatedly calling <code>nextActions()</code> (in particular, you first get
 * the actions at time 0 if you do so!).
 * 
 * You can serialize an instance of this class to disc with the 
 * <code>CAVisualResultsParser</code>. Thus, you can use this class
 * to store simulation results.
