/**
 * <p>
 * This class draws a floor in the graph (which does not explicitly exist in the graph itself). It consists of the nodes
 * belonging to rooms on one floor in a {@link ds.Project}.</p>
 * <p>
 * The nodes are stored in a display list to speed up the visualization, the display list is created if
 * {@link #performStaticDrawing(javax.media.opengl.GLAutoDrawable)} is called. During normal visualization (when
 * {@link #performStaticDrawing(javax.media.opengl.GLAutoDrawable)} is called) the display list is executed. The display
 * list is rebuilt when some settings are updated.</p>
